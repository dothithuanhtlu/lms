# Submission Status Simplification Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Submission Entity
**File:** `Submission.java`
- Updated `SubmissionStatus` enum to only include 3 statuses:
  - `NOT_SUBMITTED` - Assignment not submitted (used for tracking, but actual Submission records won't have this status)
  - `SUBMITTED` - Assignment submitted on time
  - `LATE` - Assignment submitted after due date

**Removed statuses:**
- `GRADED` - Removed because grading status is now determined by checking if `score` field is not null
- `RETURNED` - Removed as it was not being used

### 2. Updated Service Logic
**File:** `SubmissionService.java`
- Replaced all `status == GRADED` checks with `score != null` checks
- Updated grading logic to not change status to "GRADED"
- When grading a submission, the status remains either "SUBMITTED" or "LATE" based on submission timing
- Grading is indicated by having a non-null score and gradedAt timestamp

### 3. Updated Course Service Logic
**Files:** `CourseService.java`
- Updated both admin course details and student course details APIs
- Status determination logic now only uses "SUBMITTED", "LATE", or "NOT_SUBMITTED"
- For graded submissions, status remains "SUBMITTED" or "LATE", but score will be visible to indicate grading

### 4. Updated DTO Comments
**Files:** Updated comments in:
- `SubmissionDTO.java`
- `CourseFullDetailDTO.java`  
- `StudentCourseDetailDTO.java`

## How Grading Status is Now Determined

Instead of using a "GRADED" status, the system now uses:
- **score != null** → Submission has been graded
- **gradedAt != null** → Submission has been graded (timestamp when graded)
- **gradedBy** → Derived from assignment.course.teacher (grader information)

## Student View Status Logic

For students, submissions will show one of three statuses:

1. **NOT_SUBMITTED**: No submission exists for the assignment
2. **SUBMITTED**: Submission exists and was submitted on time or before due date
3. **LATE**: Submission exists but was submitted after due date

**Grading indication:** Students will know a submission is graded when:
- The `score` field contains a value
- The `feedback` field may contain teacher feedback
- The `gradedAt` field shows when it was graded

## Benefits

1. **Simplified for students**: Only 3 clear statuses
2. **Consistent logic**: Grading status determined by presence of score
3. **Flexible**: Teachers can still track grading through score and gradedAt fields
4. **Clear semantics**: Status reflects submission timing, not grading state

## API Behavior

All existing APIs continue to work:
- Assignment creation APIs work as before
- Submission APIs work as before  
- Student course details API shows simplified statuses
- Admin course details API shows simplified statuses
- Grading functionality remains intact

The change is primarily in how status is represented and determined, making it clearer for students while maintaining all functionality for teachers.
