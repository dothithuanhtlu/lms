# Test Course Full Details API with Assignment Submission Status

This script tests the enhanced `/admin/courses/{courseId}/full-details` endpoint that now includes assignment submission status for each student.

## API Endpoint
```
GET /admin/courses/{courseId}/full-details
```

## New Features Added

### Student Assignment Submission Status
Each student now includes an `assignmentSubmissions` array that shows:

- `assignmentId`: ID of the assignment
- `assignmentTitle`: Title of the assignment  
- `hasSubmitted`: Boolean indicating if student submitted
- `submissionDate`: When the assignment was submitted (if submitted)
- `score`: Score received (if graded)
- `status`: Current status ("SUBMITTED", "NOT_SUBMITTED", "LATE", "GRADED")

## PowerShell Test Script

param(
    [int]$CourseId = 1,
    [string]$BaseUrl = "http://localhost:8080"
)
