# Lesson Management System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive lesson management system implemented for the LMS project, including all entities, services, and APIs created.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Removed `currentStudents` field** from Course entity
- **Updated CourseDTO** to calculate `currentStudents` dynamically from enrollments count
- All related classes now calculate student count on-demand

### 2. Entity Structure Created

#### Core Lesson Entities
- **Lesson**: Main lesson entity with title, content, order, duration, and publish status
- **LessonDocument**: File attachments for lessons (PDF, video, documents, etc.)
- **Assignment**: Assignments, quizzes, exams with types and scoring
- **Question**: Individual questions within assignments
- **QuestionOption**: Multiple choice options for questions
- **Submission**: Student assignment submissions with grading

#### Entity Relationships
- Course → Lessons (One-to-Many)
- Course → Assignments (One-to-Many)
- Lesson → LessonDocuments (One-to-Many)
- Assignment → Questions (One-to-Many)
- Assignment → Submissions (One-to-Many)
- Question → QuestionOptions (One-to-Many)

### 3. Repository Layer
Created comprehensive repository interfaces with specialized query methods:
- `LessonRepository`: Find by course, order management, publish status filtering
- `LessonDocumentRepository`: File type filtering, lesson association
- `AssignmentRepository`: Course/type filtering, due date queries, publish status
- `QuestionRepository`: Assignment association, question type filtering
- `QuestionOptionRepository`: Question association, correct answer queries
- `SubmissionRepository`: Student/assignment association, grading status

### 4. DTO Layer
Complete DTO structure for all entities:
- **LessonDTO, LessonCreateDTO**: Lesson data transfer and creation
- **LessonDocumentDTO**: File metadata and download information
- **AssignmentDTO, AssignmentCreateDTO**: Assignment management
- **QuestionDTO, QuestionOptionDTO**: Quiz/exam question structure
- **SubmissionDTO**: Student submission tracking

### 5. Service Layer
Implemented comprehensive business logic:

#### LessonService
- `getLessonsByCourseId()`: Retrieve lessons for a course
- `createLesson()`: Create new lesson with automatic ordering
- `updateLesson()`: Update lesson content and metadata
- `publishLesson()/unpublishLesson()`: Control lesson visibility
- `reorderLessons()`: Change lesson sequence
- `deleteLesson()`: Remove lesson and associated content

#### AssignmentService
- `getAssignmentsByCourseId()`: All assignments for a course
- `getPublishedAssignmentsByCourseId()`: Student-visible assignments
- `getAssignmentsByType()`: Filter by HOMEWORK, QUIZ, EXAM, etc.
- `createAssignment()`: Create assignments with proper validation
- `updateAssignment()`: Modify assignment details
- `publishAssignment()/unpublishAssignment()`: Control assignment visibility
- `countAssignmentsByCourse()`: Statistics for dashboard

### 6. REST API Layer
Created RESTful controllers with complete CRUD operations:

#### LessonController (`/api/lessons`)
- `GET /course/{courseId}`: List all lessons for a course
- `GET /{lessonId}`: Get specific lesson details
- `POST /`: Create new lesson
- `PUT /{lessonId}`: Update lesson
- `DELETE /{lessonId}`: Delete lesson
- `PUT /{lessonId}/publish`: Make lesson visible to students
- `PUT /{lessonId}/unpublish`: Hide lesson from students
- `PUT /course/{courseId}/reorder`: Change lesson order

#### AssignmentController (`/api/assignments`)
- `GET /course/{courseId}`: List all assignments for a course
- `GET /course/{courseId}/published`: Student-visible assignments
- `GET /course/{courseId}/type`: Filter by assignment type
- `GET /{assignmentId}`: Get specific assignment
- `POST /`: Create new assignment
- `PUT /{assignmentId}`: Update assignment
- `DELETE /{assignmentId}`: Delete assignment
- `PUT /{assignmentId}/publish`: Publish assignment
- `PUT /{assignmentId}/unpublish`: Hide assignment
- `GET /course/{courseId}/count`: Assignment statistics

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Dynamic Student Count Calculation
- Removed database field dependency
- Real-time calculation from enrollment relationships
- Maintains data consistency automatically

### 2. Flexible Content Management
- Support for multiple document types (VIDEO, PDF, DOC, IMAGE, AUDIO)
- Lesson ordering and sequencing
- Publish/unpublish workflow for content control

### 3. Comprehensive Assignment System
- Multiple assignment types (HOMEWORK, QUIZ, EXAM, PROJECT, ESSAY)
- Question types (MULTIPLE_CHOICE, TRUE_FALSE, SHORT_ANSWER, ESSAY, FILL_BLANK)
- Time limits and due date management
- Late submission controls

### 4. Submission and Grading Framework
- Student submission tracking
- Grading workflow (PENDING, GRADED, RETURNED)
- Score management and feedback system

## Database Schema Changes

### Course Entity Updates
```sql
-- Removed field
-- currentStudents INT DEFAULT 0

-- Dynamic calculation in application layer
-- currentStudents = enrollments.size()
```

### New Tables Created
- `lessons`: Core lesson content
- `lesson_documents`: File attachments
- `assignments`: Assignments, quizzes, exams
- `questions`: Individual questions
- `question_options`: Multiple choice options
- `submissions`: Student submissions

## API Usage Examples

### Creating a Lesson
```http
POST /api/lessons
{
  "title": "Introduction to Java",
  "description": "Basic Java concepts",
  "content": "Lesson content here...",
  "courseId": 1,
  "durationMinutes": 60,
  "isPublished": false
}
```

### Creating an Assignment
```http
POST /api/assignments
{
  "title": "Java Quiz 1",
  "description": "Basic Java concepts quiz",
  "assignmentType": "QUIZ",
  "courseId": 1,
  "maxScore": 100.0,
  "timeLimitMinutes": 30,
  "dueDate": "2025-06-15T23:59:59",
  "isPublished": true
}
```

### Getting Course Lessons
```http
GET /api/lessons/course/1
```

### Publishing Content
```http
PUT /api/lessons/123/publish
PUT /api/assignments/456/publish
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Validation
- Jakarta Bean Validation annotations
- Custom business rule validation in services
- Proper error handling with ResourceNotFoundException

### Database Relationships
- Proper cascade configurations (ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
- Lazy loading for performance
- Bi-directional relationships where needed

### Response Handling
- Consistent HTTP status codes
- Structured error responses
- Automatic response formatting via @ControllerAdvice

## Future Enhancements Possible
1. File upload endpoints for lesson documents
2. Question bank management
3. Assignment templates
4. Bulk operations for lessons/assignments
5. Analytics and reporting endpoints
6. Integration with external content providers
7. Real-time collaboration features
8. Mobile API optimizations

## Conclusion
The lesson management system provides a complete foundation for course content delivery and assessment. The implementation follows Spring Boot best practices with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and a RESTful API design.
