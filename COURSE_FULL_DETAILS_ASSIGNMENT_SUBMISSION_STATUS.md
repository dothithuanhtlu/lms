Enhanced the `/admin/courses/{courseId}/full-details` API to include assignment submission status for each student enrolled in the course.

## API Endpoint
```
GET /admin/courses/{courseId}/full-details
```

## Enhancement Details

### Added Field: `assignmentSubmissions`
Each student object now includes an `assignmentSubmissions` array containing detailed submission information for every assignment in the course.

### Assignment Submission Status Fields

#### `assignmentSubmissions` Array
Each element contains:

- **`assignmentId`** (Long): Unique identifier of the assignment
- **`assignmentTitle`** (String): Title of the assignment
- **`hasSubmitted`** (Boolean): Whether the student has submitted this assignment
- **`submissionDate`** (LocalDateTime): When the assignment was submitted (null if not submitted)
- **`score`** (Float): Score received for the assignment (null if not graded)
- **`status`** (String): Current submission status

#### Status Types

1. **`"NOT_SUBMITTED"`**: Student has not submitted the assignment
2. **`"SUBMITTED"`**: Student has submitted on time, but not yet graded
3. **`"LATE"`**: Student submitted after the due date, but not yet graded
4. **`"GRADED"`**: Assignment has been graded and score is available

## Implementation Details

### Database Changes
- No database schema changes required
- Uses existing `Submission` table relationships

### Code Changes

1. **CourseFullDetailDTO.java**
   - Added `AssignmentSubmissionStatus` inner class
   - Added `assignmentSubmissions` field to `StudentInfo` class

2. **CourseService.java**
   - Enhanced `getCourseFullDetails()` method to populate submission data
   - Added logic to determine submission status based on submission date and grading

### Performance Considerations
- Uses existing optimized queries to avoid N+1 problems
- Submission data is fetched efficiently using `findByAssignmentIdAndStudentId()`
- Status calculation is done in memory to minimize database calls

## Usage Examples

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Fetch course details with submission status
const courseDetails = await fetch(`/admin/courses/${courseId}/full-details`)
  .then(response => response.json());

// Display student submission status
courseDetails.students.forEach(student => {
  console.log(`Student: ${student.fullName}`);
  
  student.assignmentSubmissions.forEach(submission => {
    console.log(`  Assignment: ${submission.assignmentTitle}`);
    console.log(`  Status: ${submission.status}`);
    console.log(`  Submitted: ${submission.hasSubmitted ? 'Yes' : 'No'}`);
    
    if (submission.score !== null) {
      console.log(`  Score: ${submission.score}`);
    }
  });
});
```

### Check Submission Statistics
```javascript
// Calculate submission statistics
const calculateSubmissionStats = (courseDetails) => {
  const stats = {
    totalAssignments: courseDetails.assignments.length,
    totalStudents: courseDetails.students.length,
    submissionsByStatus: {
      'SUBMITTED': 0,
      'NOT_SUBMITTED': 0,
      'LATE': 0,
      'GRADED': 0
    }
  };
  
  courseDetails.students.forEach(student => {
    student.assignmentSubmissions.forEach(submission => {
      stats.submissionsByStatus[submission.status]++;
    });
  });
  
  return stats;
};
```

## Testing

### Test Script
Use the provided PowerShell script:
```powershell
.\test_course_full_details_with_submissions.ps1 -CourseId 1
```

### Manual Testing
1. Create a course with students and assignments
2. Have some students submit assignments
3. Call the API endpoint
4. Verify that submission status is correctly displayed for each student

## Benefits

1. **Complete Overview**: Teachers can see all student submission statuses in one API call
2. **Efficient**: No need for multiple API calls to check individual submission status
3. **Detailed Status**: Clear indication of submission state and grading progress
4. **Frontend Ready**: Data structure is optimized for frontend display components
5. **Performance Optimized**: Uses efficient queries to avoid performance issues

## Migration Notes

- **Backward Compatible**: Existing API consumers will continue to work as before
- **No Breaking Changes**: Only adds new fields, doesn't modify existing ones
- **Gradual Adoption**: Frontend can gradually implement the new submission status features

This enhancement provides a comprehensive view of student progress and assignment completion status, making it easier for teachers and administrators to track student performance and engagement.
