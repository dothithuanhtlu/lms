# Assignment Deletion API - Complete Implementation

## Overview
The assignment deletion functionality has been enhanced to provide comprehensive cleanup of both database records and associated files stored on Cloudinary.

## API Endpoint

**DELETE** `/v1/api/assignments/{assignmentId}`

- **Authentication**: Required (JWT Bearer token)
- **Authorization**: Teacher role required
- **Parameters**: 
  - `assignmentId` (Long): The ID of the assignment to delete

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Deletion Process

The `deleteAssignment` method in `AssignmentService` now performs the following operations:

1. **Validation**: Verifies the assignment exists
2. **Cloudinary Cleanup**: 
   - Deletes all assignment document files from folder `lms/assignments/{assignmentId}`
   - Deletes all submission files from folders `lms/submissions/{submissionId}` for each submission
3. **Database Cleanup**: Deletes the assignment record (cascade operations handle related entities)

### Database Cascade Operations

The `Assignment` entity has proper cascade configurations:

```java
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "assignment", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
private List<Submission> submissions = new ArrayList<>();

@OneToMany(mappedBy = "assignment", fetch = FetchType.LAZY, cascade = CascadeType.ALL, orphanRemoval = true)
private List<AssignmentDocument> documents;
```

This ensures that when an assignment is deleted:
- All associated `AssignmentDocument` records are automatically deleted
- All associated `Submission` records are automatically deleted
- All associated `SubmissionDocument` records are automatically deleted (via submission cascade)

### Cloudinary File Management

The enhanced `CloudinaryService` provides robust file deletion capabilities:

#### Methods Used:
- `deleteFolder(String folderPath)`: Deletes all files in a folder and the folder itself
- `deleteResourcesByType(String folderPath, String resourceType)`: Deletes files by resource type (raw, image, video)

#### Folder Structure:
- Assignment documents: `lms/assignments/{assignmentId}/`
- Submission documents: `lms/submissions/{submissionId}/`

## Error Handling

### Transactional Safety
- The entire deletion operation is wrapped in `@Transactional`
- If Cloudinary deletion fails, the operation continues but logs warnings
- Database deletion only proceeds if no critical errors occur

### Logging
Comprehensive logging at multiple levels:
- INFO: Process milestones and successful operations
- WARN: Non-critical failures (e.g., files already deleted)
- ERROR: Critical failures that require attention

### Error Scenarios Handled:
1. **Assignment not found**: Returns 404 with appropriate message
2. **Cloudinary service unavailable**: Logs warning, continues with database deletion
3. **Partial file deletion failure**: Logs details of failed files, continues operation
4. **Database constraints**: Transaction rollback ensures data consistency

## Security Considerations

### Authorization
- Only authenticated users can call this endpoint
- Teacher role validation (implemented in controller layer)
- Assignment ownership validation (teacher can only delete assignments from their courses)

### Data Privacy
- All associated student submissions are permanently deleted
- File deletion from Cloudinary is irreversible
- Operation is logged for audit purposes

## Response Format

### Successful Deletion
```json
{
  "error": null,
  "message": "Assignment deleted successfully",
  "data": null
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND",
  "message": "Assignment not found with id: 123",
  "data": null
}
```

## Testing

### Test Script
Use the provided PowerShell script `test_delete_assignment.ps1` to test the functionality:

```powershell
.\test_delete_assignment.ps1
```

### Test Scenarios Covered:
1. **Authentication**: Verifies JWT token is required
2. **Assignment Creation**: Creates test assignment with files
3. **Deletion Process**: Executes delete operation
4. **Verification**: Confirms assignment is removed from database
5. **File Cleanup**: Logs indicate Cloudinary files are deleted

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. Create an assignment with multiple document files
2. Have students submit files to the assignment
3. Call the delete endpoint
4. Verify:
   - Assignment is removed from database
   - Assignment folder is deleted from Cloudinary
   - All submission folders are deleted from Cloudinary
   - Related database records are cascade deleted

## Performance Considerations

### Batch Operations
- Cloudinary deletions are performed in batches (max 100 files per batch)
- Concurrent processing for multiple submissions
- Timeout handling for large file operations

### Monitoring
- Detailed logging for performance monitoring
- Error tracking for failed deletions
- Success metrics for completed operations

## Maintenance

### Regular Cleanup
- Monitor Cloudinary for orphaned files
- Implement periodic cleanup jobs if needed
- Archive deletion logs for audit purposes

### Backup Considerations
- Ensure backups are taken before bulk deletions
- Consider soft delete for high-value assignments
- Implement recovery procedures for accidental deletions

## Related Endpoints

- `GET /assignments` - List assignments
- `POST /assignments/create-with-files` - Create assignment with files
- `PUT /assignments/{id}` - Update assignment
- `DELETE /submissions/{id}` - Delete individual submission (similar cleanup logic)

## Implementation Files

### Core Service
- `AssignmentService.deleteAssignment()` - Main deletion logic
- `CloudinaryService.deleteFolder()` - File cleanup
- `CloudinaryService.deleteResourcesByType()` - Type-specific deletion

### Entities
- `Assignment.java` - Cascade configuration
- `Submission.java` - Related entity cleanup
- `AssignmentDocument.java` - Document management

### Testing
- `test_delete_assignment.ps1` - Comprehensive test script
- Unit tests for service methods
- Integration tests for API endpoints

This implementation ensures complete and safe deletion of assignments with proper cleanup of all associated resources.
